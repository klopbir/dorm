          <p>During my study in Shanghai Tongji university, I was able to get to HSK 4(265). In my experience although people say chinese is the hardest language of all, I would everything is based on efforts you put on. To be honest nowadays the techniques for learning languages have improved so much that I feel confident to say it is possible to learn any language in 8 month from top to bottom. As with Chinese Supertest app was my tutor in this road, and of course my teachers in Shanghai.</p>

          <p>In my experience, Modern China is a testament to technological advancement and efficiency. With almost every grandma having smartphone, apps such as WeChat and Alipay have revolutionized daily life. From messaging and social networking to mobile payments and online shopping, these platforms have seamlessly integrated into every aspect of society. The QR code system has become ubiquitous, simplifying transactions, access control, and even health monitoring. Furthermore, China's massive systematization efforts, like facial recognition technology and smart city initiatives, have propelled it towards an organized and interconnected society.</p>
